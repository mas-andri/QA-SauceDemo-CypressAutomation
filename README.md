# üß™ SausceDemo - Cypress Automation Testing

SauceDemo is a web-based e-commerce demo application created by Sauce Labs for practicing and testing software quality assurance, automation, and performance testing. The application simulates a simple online store where users can log in, browse products, add items to a cart, sort products, proceed through a checkout process, and log out.

The primary objective of testing is to validate core features such as login, product catalog, shopping cart, and the checkout flow to ensure alignment with user requirements and software quality standards
